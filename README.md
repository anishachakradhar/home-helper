## Objective

- Help find the correct people for helping us to solve our household problems.

## Description

The main idea of the project is to find the correct people for helping us to solve our household problems.

The common problems in our house are repairing a tap, fixing fuse or switch issues or anything related to electricity, fixing problems that may arise in our electronic appliances like television, laptops, grinder, etc painting a room or a house collection of old or unused household stuff or furniture and there can be many.

The solution to this problem is finding people who are good with a particular skill. There can be many ways to contact them but as mostly seen and heard its mostly through connections i.e someone referring that person for work. The problem with this is sometimes you wouldn't find a person for a problem or you have to wait for someone to refer them to you and it becomes difficult to know where you can find a correct person.

Hence, our platform brings all such people who are good in a particular skill together. This platform is for all the general people with local skills that are needed in our society. or at home. Anyone with any skill where qualification isn't necessary can create their own profile, add their contact information and location.

People with household problems can search for people with the particular skill and even on the basis of location and solve their problems. It is beneficial to both sides. This not only solves our problems occuring in our daily lives but also helps the people to get income generating opportunities.
